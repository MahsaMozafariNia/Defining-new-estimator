# Defining-new-estimator

In this project, I am going to define a new estimator. It is the KNN model with different similarity metrics and prediction computing. Note that, the main goal here is just to see how was can define new estimators. So, I did not do data cleaning. At the end, you can use GridSearchCV to find the best parametrs (n_neighbors, similarity)
